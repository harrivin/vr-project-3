The project begins with a scene that contains a house and a garage, it also describes how the tangible assets in the house and the garage change from year to year based on the per capita income.\r\nThe motivation behind the project is to visualize a dataset and predict how the lifestyle of an average person living The United States changes from year to year based on the per capita income.\r\nThe given experience uses first person perspective, head tracking and stereoscopic rendering to put the user in the Visualization scene. The user can move around the scene using a X-box Joystick(left stick) and can change the value of the slider(years) using \"A\" and \"X\" buttons.\r\n\r\n### Dataset Used\r\nThe Dataset used is from the Current Population Survey and contains the Per Capita Income of All Races from 1967 - 2014\r\nLink :- http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/people/2014/p01AR.xls\r\n\r\n### Video of the Virtual Experience\r\nYoutube Link :- \r\n\r\n### Insights Gained\r\n1)How the Tangible Assets of an average US Citizen changes with the Per Capita Income every year\r\n2)The Tangible Assets the average US Citizen can afford based on his Income every year\r\n\r\n### Quantifying Simulator Sickness\r\nThe Participants were given the Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire(http://www.cybersickness.org/data/Post.doc) post the VR experience\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJeffrey Wood(@jmwood22) , Kishan Rao (@kishanrao92) , Harrivin Nachiappan (@harrivin)\r\n\r\n",
