  "name": "Visualization of Per Capita Income in VR",
  "tagline": "Project on VR and Music, Art, or Visualization",
  "body": "### Description and Motivation\r\nThe project presented is a Virtual Reality visualization of the dataset on the GDP per capita income(all races) in the United States from the year 1967-2014. The project begins with a scene that contains a house and a garage, it describes how the standard of living(material goods) in the house and the garage change from year to year based on the GDP per capita income of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind the project is to visualize a dataset and predict how the standard of living(material goods) of an average person living the United States changes from year to year based on the GDP per capita income.\r\n\r\nThe given experience uses first person perspective, head tracking and stereoscopic rendering to put the user in the Visualization scene. The user can move around the scene using a X-box Joystick(left stick) and can change the value of the slider(years) using \"B\" and \"X\" buttons.\r\n\r\n### Dataset Used\r\nThe Dataset used is from the Current Population Survey and contains the Per Capita Income of All Races from 1967 - 2014\r\nLink :- http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/people/2014/p01AR.xls\r\n\r\n### Intro\r\nThe Participants where told what GDP is and how the GDP per capita income is calculated\r\n\r\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period(a year in this case)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita income = GDP(US) / total population of that specific region(US)\r\n\r\nThe users were also shown a line graph of the GDP per capita of an US citizen from 1967-2014\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qi04a5jcwihaa47/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-31%20at%209.33.58%20AM.png?dl=0\r\n\r\n### Video of the Virtual Experience\r\nYoutube Link :- \r\n\r\n### Insights Gained\r\n1)How the GDP per capita income affects the Standard of Living(Material Goods)?\r\n2)What is GDP and how it changes over the years?\r\n\r\n### Quantifying Simulator Sickness\r\nThe Participants were given the Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire(http://www.cybersickness.org/data/Post.doc) post the VR experience\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJeffrey Wood(@jmwood22) , Kishan Rao (@kishanrao92) , Harrivin Nachiappan (@harrivin)\r\n\r\n",
